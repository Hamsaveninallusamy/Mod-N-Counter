# Mod-N-Counter
A MOD-N counter, also known as a modulo-N counter, is a digital counter that cycles through a sequence of states from 0 to N-1 before resetting to 0. It is typically implemented using flip-flops, where the number of flip-flops determines the modulus of the counter. The counter can be synchronous, with all flip-flops triggered by the same clock signal, or asynchronous, with each flip-flop triggered by the output of the previous one. MOD-N counters are commonly used in applications such as digital clocks and frequency dividers. For example, a MOD-4 counter will count from 0 to 3 in binary (00, 01, 10, 11) and then reset to 0.
